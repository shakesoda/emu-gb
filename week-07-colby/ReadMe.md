# Fall project #

Hacked up as an extension of my week 3 project, which would've filled this role much better.

## Instructions ##
* get deps with bundle install
* run 'rake', or run 'rake profile' to output ruby-prof profile report
* Go to http://localhost:4567/build to create the sqlite database
* Visit http://localhost:4567 in any half-decent browser and have fun
