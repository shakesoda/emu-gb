About
=====
Not particularly an engine, a specific game, or anything else you might care
about. Feel free to use bits of the code if there's anything you like.

Requirements
============
- Python 2.7
- gcc, g++ (other compilers untested, but clang should also work)
- opengl headers (libgl1-mesa-dev)
- xorg stuff (xrandr, xxf86vm, xkb. xorg-dev should cover it.)
- autotools (autoregen, autoconf, automake)

I haven't tried building on anything not debian based, it should work though.

Compiling
=========
./autogen
make -j<cores+1>
